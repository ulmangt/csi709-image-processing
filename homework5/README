============ Running geoff_ulman_homework5.py =============
===========================================================

1) Ensure that the CSI709 class python scripts from Blackboard (eface, sophia, etc...) and the boatsmall.jpg image are available on the python path.

2) Run the following in python (for alpha = 0.4):

import geoff_ulman_homework5 as hw
filt, corr, centered_boats = hw.main_allboats( 0.4 )

3) To run peak detection (note that different alpha arguments will require different thresholds for reasonable results):

hw.countPeaks( corr, 0.000012 )

4) To run training against two of the ships:

filt, corr, centered_boats = hw.main_missingboat( 0.4 )
hw.countPeaks( corr, 0.000009 )
