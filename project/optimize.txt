Traditional Superresolution

Single Image Superresolution:

 (nearest neighbor, bilinear)

Describe patch superresolution algorithm

Image from paper

Show example of similar patches

Mathematical model -> high res to low res image

Show example of constraints

NEOS Ampl solver:

Show Ampl model

Poor results (why?)
 - adjust patch constraint weights based on similarity
 - had to work with small images, less opportunity for good patch similarity


Describe multi-scale method (generalization of single-scale patch based)
