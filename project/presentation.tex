\begin{frame}{Multiple Frame Super-Resolution}

Let \( {L_1,...,L_n} \) be a set of images of the same scene.

\vspace{0.3cm}

Assume these images were all derived from a high resolution source image \(H\).

\vspace{0.3cm}

Each low resolution image \(L_j\) was generated by \emph{blurring} and \emph{subsampling} from \(H\).

\vspace{0.3cm}

The \emph{blurring} operation is a convolution with a Gaussian (or similar) kernel \(B_j\).

\begin{figure}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
L_j = \left( H \otimes B_j \right) \left( q \right) \downarrow s_j
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Multiple Frame Super-Resolution}

We can write an equation describing each pixel \(L_j(p)\) of the \(j^{th}\) low resolution image in terms of nearby pixels \(H(q_i)\) in the high resolution image.

\begin{figure}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
L_j(p) = \sum_{q_i \in Support(B_j)} H( q_i ) B_j( q_i - q )
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{figure}

For large enough \(j\) this system becomes \emph{over determined} and we can use least squares to approximate the unknown pixels \(H(q)\) in the high resolution image.

Images often contain many similar regions.

Break up the problem into many small multiple image super resolution problems.

\vspace{0.3cm}

For each small patch of the image:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{similar_patches_3.png}
\end{figure}

Search the entire image for similar patches:

\end{figure}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{What If We Only Have One Image?}

Now we're back to the multiple image super resolution formulation (at least for this small portion of the image).

\vspace{0.3cm}

In practice, the patches are quite small ( around 5 by 5 pixels ):
